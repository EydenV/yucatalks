title: SOLID Principles
description: We dive into the history and motivation of the SOLID principles which conform a guide of good practices for object oriented programming (OOP), build the basis of object oriented design (OOD) and help developers deliver clean code. In this episode we see every principle, give examples and discuss how important every principle is and which problem is trying to solve.
